Custom branding for washinfo.org

There are two key files that live on the ActivityInfo.org application 
server:

  - Scaffolding.ftl: A FreeMarker template that is used as the basis for all
    FreeMarker-rendered pages (everything expect the main GWT app)
    
  - HomePageBody.html: Static HTML that is served for the root.
  

These two files have to be uploaded to activityinfo.org.

The rest are static files and can be hosted using GitHub pages.
